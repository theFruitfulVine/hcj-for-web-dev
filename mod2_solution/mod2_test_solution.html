<h1>The Apostles of the Lamb</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-11"><div class="Peter">Peter</div><p>A man of Faith and Power. Did all the Master wanted him to do - being the leader of the Apostles. He, an unstable man, was transformed by the Lord Jesus Christ into a Rock, and an Apostle, on whom the Church was built. He had nothing left inthe ordinary, no wonder he could give all for the extraordinary.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-11"><div class="Paul">Paul</div><p>A man of Grace and Works. Proved that Christianity was not limited to being a Jew alone, nor having the physical presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, but rather intimate fellowship with the Spirit, and receiving the mysteries what were hidden in years before and for years to come. One of the greatest of them all. Worked the Talk and got the results.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-11 col-sm-11" ><div class="John">John</div><p>The Apostle of Love. Beloved and Dearly beloved, just like Daniel. Quiet, butinsightful in all things seen and unseen. Leaned on the breast of the Lord Jesus Christ as a display of deep affection for Him. The only things he longed for were the knowledge of His Words and the meanings thereoff. He was indeed a man whom Jesus Loved.</p></div>
